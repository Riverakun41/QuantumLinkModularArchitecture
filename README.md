# QuantumLinkModularArchitecture
Study of a model of Quantum Link for the implementation of it into a Modular Architecture for Quantum Computers

In this github we aim to share some experimental results of a Quantum Link, following the model of the following image

Khan, J., Reyes, S. N., Rached, S. B., Alarcon, E., Bolivar, P. H., Almudever, C. G., & Abadal, S. (2025). Waveguide QED Analysis of Quantum-Coherent Links for Modular Quantum Computing. arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.11972.

This study can be seen as an extension of the model presented in the paper, to incorporate some tunable couplers.
